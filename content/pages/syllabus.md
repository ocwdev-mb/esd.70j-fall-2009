Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 4 sessions in one week, 2 hours / session

Introduction
------------

This intensive micro-subject provides the necessary skills in MicrosoftÂ® Excel spreadsheet modeling for ESD.71 _Engineering Systems Analysis for Design_. It is also useful for a variety of other subjects. Its crux is the dynamic rather than the general deterministic modeling.

Its purpose is to bring entering students up to speed on some of the advanced techniques that we routinely use in analysis. It is motivated by our experience that many students only have an introductory knowledge of Excel, and thus waste a lot of time thrashing about unproductively. Many people think they know Excel, but overlook many efficient tools, such as Data Table and Goal Seek.

We assume students know Excel basics such as referencing, names, functions, and formulas. If you do not know these basics, please get yourself an introductory manual and learn them.

Three units of credit are offered to those who care to complete the assignment. However, we expect most students will simply learn from doing the worked out examples in class, and will not require credit.

**Day 1: NPV and sensitivity analysis**

Objective: Set up spreadsheet properly for efficiency, set up charts, and understand sensitivity analysis by Data Table


{{< tdclose >}}

{{< trclose >}}
{{< tropen >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


1\. Proper set-up of spreadsheets: entire entries of input in separate area; set up by formulas (the question is generated from the self-assessment problem)

2\. One-way/two-way Data Table (one-way Data Table: for sensitivity on the discount rate for Plan B while the discount rate for Plan A is fixed; two-way Data Table: for sensitivity on variable costs of Plan A and B; using Goal Seek functionality to find the maximum of variable cost for Plan A so that Plan A is still favored)

3\. Drawings (plot the difference of NPVs for the two plans)

4\. Reference point for the function of "NPV" (also, students need to know how to set up the NPVs using formulas), examples of the use of "Text" function
